## Description

This Java program calculates the average grade based on the scores of five courses: Mathematics, Physics, Turkish, History, and Music. It prompts the user to enter the grades for each course and then calculates the average grade. If any entered grade is invalid (less than or equal to 0 or greater than 100), it prompts the user with a message and considers the grade as 0, reducing the counter for valid grades. Finally, it evaluates the average grade and informs the user whether they passed the class or need to repeat it based on a passing threshold of 55.

## Instructions

1. **Compilation:** Ensure you have Java installed on your system. Compile the `Main.java` file using a Java compiler.


2. **Execution:** Run the compiled program.


3. **Usage:** Follow the prompts on the command line to enter the grades for each course. The program will calculate the average grade and inform you whether you passed the class or need to repeat it.

## Requirements

- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on the system.
- Terminal or command prompt to execute Java commands.

## Note

- This program assumes a passing threshold of 55 for the average grade.
- Invalid grades (less than or equal to 0 or greater than 100) are considered as 0 and decrease the counter for valid grades accordingly.
